## Installation:
**For normal people:**

Download [fabric for minecraft 1.14/1.15/1.16](https://fabricmc.net/use/)  
Download the lastest compiled version of bleachhack for your Minecraft version [from the releases section](https://github.com/BleachDrinker420/bleachhack-1.14/releases)

On Windows: type %appdata% into the location field of the Windows Explorer; then open '.minecraft'.

On Mac: click on the desktop, press Command+Shift+G, type ~/Library and press enter; then open 'Application Support' and finally '.minecraft'.

On Linux: in a terminal window, type 'xdg-open ~/.minecraft'... or if you like working at the commandline, 'cd ~/.minecraft'.

Then inside that folder, you should see a folder named 'mods'. (If you don't see one, make sure you've installed Fabric already and started Minecraft again once).
That's where you'll put any mods you want to install.
